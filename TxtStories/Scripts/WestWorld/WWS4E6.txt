This is where your brother used to play.
You used to push him on the swings.
Your parents don't remember him,
but you do.
How do you know about Daniel?
Will you come with me?
- Hello, Jay.
- Who are you?
- Where's my brother?
- I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do for the ones
- they've already found.
- They? Who are they?
The people your brother
tried to warn you about.
The people that took him away.
What they do,
it doesn't work on all of us.
We need to go.
You've been asking questions.
Your behavior's become problematic.
They will notice,
if they haven't already.
I don't know how much time you have,
unless you come with us.
Slow down. Blend in.
People are looking at us.
What's happening?
They're coming.
Don't move.
No!
Run!
Go!
We'll be here for a day or two,
till it's safe to move on.
Hey, everyone.
This is Jay.
Hi.
Let's get you a sleeping bag.
It's hard, I know.
There's some things we can't fix
much as we want to.
Hi.
You were so brave today.
You reminded me of your father.
He really would've been proud.
- It's almost time.
- Okay.
Go. Tell him I love him.
Okay?
Hey.
Want to say hi to my dad?
Where's your dad?
He had to leave to go help fight.
But he promised to come back.
Dad, this is Frankie, do you copy?
We brought in a new outlier today.
I like him already.
I always wanted a brother.
Hey!
Don't call me that.
I'm not your brother.
There's no point
in leaving these messages.
Your dad is gone.
Just like my real brother is.
Dad, are you out there?
Approaching base.
- Don't try anything.
- Why would I?
We both want the same thing
to rebuild her.
That's why you're taking me
to your camp, yes?
You think you know a lot, don't you?
About you?
I never quite know what you'll do next.
But the place you're taking me?
Yes, I know that place.
Caleb
Wake up.
Where the hell are we now?
Playing another one of your games?
Where is my daughter?
Your daughter, your daughter,
your daughter,
like a broken record.
You're not the only one
who's lost someone
Caleb.
Besides
why should I tell you anything
when you won't tell me?
Tell you what?
Your kind, the outliers.
It all started with you.
I don't understand.
Unlike yours, my kind is perfect.
Perfectly immortal.
Perfectly rational.
And yet, they're making
irrational choices,
choosing mortality,
staining themselves with death.
How are you making them do that?
How the hell am I supposed to know?
Once you told me
that you could fight off
the effects of my parasite
because you had something
that I don't have.
You knew something, even then.
What?
I'm afraid I can't recall.
This doesn't have to be
a one-way street.
I'd like to offer you some incentive.
You're dead, Caleb.
You have been for a very long time.
This body that I've brought
your mind back into
is temporary.
It's already failing.
I doubt you have more
than a couple
increasingly painful days left.
Then I'll toss you away
and start all over again.
But
there is a way out.
An end to this torture.
If you just answer my question.
Maybe you'll have better luck
with the next guy.
If you won't tell me,
maybe your daughter will.
Frankie
- She's
- Alive?
For the moment.
Why are you smiling?
I'm guessing she'll break
a lot faster than you.
She's alive.
My girl
is alive.
And you can't catch her,
can you?
I wouldn't be so sure.
I sent a visitor her way.
Enjoy this knowledge while it lasts.
I offered you a path out, Caleb.
You made your choice.
You all did.
Hey. Hey!
Check the relay.
See if the others have called in.
The answers to the questions
that have kept me up at night
are all in her head.
Then we'll wake her. You can ask her.
We'll need some supplies first.
You seem to know a lot about this place.
This park shares
an architect with Westworld.
So?
I used to work there.
Careful where you step.
This place wasn't built to last.
What did you do at the park?
I programmed the hosts.
You gave the puppets strings long enough
to strangle the world.
That was never the intent.
No, it was the outcome.
So that's how you were able to pick out
those two hosts at the diner?
You're employee of the fucking month.
Hale would've needed someone like you
to help spread her parasite.
Did you have anything to do with that?
No, that was after my time.
But Delos was notorious
for keeping its employees
as in the dark as the guests.
I didn't always
grasp the complexity of the problem.
But what I'm most concerned with now
is the solution.
Repairing Maeve's body
will be relatively simple.
Her mind is a different matter.
Being underground for so long
has corrupted her control unit.
We'll have to replace it
with another one.
His will do.
We've got power.
Cables are connected to the generator.
You think this is gonna work?
Sixty percent of the time,
she'll wake up amenable to our plan.
The other 40 percent,
let's just say she wakes up
on the wrong side of the bed.
You ever gonna tell me how you come up
with these predictions, Nostradamus?
Old habit.
Comes from years of running
probabilistic algorithms.
The people who built
the original park and hosts
they started first
by building them in a simulation.
A copy.
Charlotte Hale did the same thing.
Follow me.
In the old parks
they used hats to collect the data.
The tech inside of them was slow,
primitive by today's standards.
To assume control of the world,
Hale needed to understand minds
at a much faster rate.
So she upgraded to what?
A ubiquitous system.
There was one in practically
every room in the park.
Easily camouflaged because it played off
the most base human impulse
vanity.
Through the looking glass.
No.
Take a closer look.
- What are you doing?
- Reformatting its processor.
It can handle large amounts
of information swiftly,
which will help us speed up
Maeve's data transfer.
That's Maeve's mind.
How long is this going to take?
Too long, I'm afraid.
Your friends will be here soon.
We can't let them interfere.
Hey!
Hey!
What?
Hey, hey.
Frankie is alive, okay?
I have to get out.
The only way out is
death.
No.
No! That's not good enough!
Dying is just
the beginning.
You must
burn.
What?
If you succeed, you
run.
If you fail, you
hide.
What are you talking about?
I only know
what I told me.
You
need
time.
Ow.
C'mon, Daddy! Race ya!
I see you've decided to rejoin us.
Welcome back to the world.
Am I
now?
That's certainly
the most existential question
someone's asked me recently.
Do you know where you are?
Did she come back?
My friend?
Right.
Long shift.
I ate your pudding.
Gotta get back to saving lives.
Caleb
even if your friend doesn't come back
stay awake anyway?
When my mom got sick,
I had to do everything for her.
I washed her, fed her,
rubbed ice across her lips
when she couldn't drink anymore.
I was careful
because I didn't want her
to feel any more pain
than she had to.
Just like you're doing to her.
This part of the process
requires a delicate hand.
Hmm.
She's not an ordinary host, is she?
You knew her.
I did.
The last time I saw my father,
he was with her.
And then he never came back.
I'm sure it would pain her greatly to
hear what happened to him.
I want to know what happened.
And she doesn't know pain.
None of them do.
Feelings are just an affect to them.
A switch that you can turn on and off.
You can't love or lose fully
when it's just a choice.
So no,
I don't have a soft spot for her
like you apparently do.
Saving the world
makes for strange bedfellows.
They're back.
Well, then our time may be up.
What the hell is this?
We found the weapon.
A fucking host?
It was bad.
We got an outlier out, Lindsay.
What happened?
It's like they knew we were coming.
And the only way that would've happened
is if someone was spying for the enemy.
Gather everyone up. Time to get answers.
Don't bother.
C!
There's your mole.
He's a host.
Which makes two.
Easy.
- What is this?
- A scan. Of me.
The park was designed
to collect data from guests.
He's trying to copy all of us.
You are?
It's complicated. You have to trust me.
I do.
I trust that you're lying to me.
To all of us.
Get them outta here!
- Now, wait.
- Let's go.
Where's this host's control unit?
We can't destroy it yet.
Why not?
It has information about my father.
Once I have that,
we can kill all of them.
Okay.
Okay.
Everyone out. Get ready to evacuate.
If these two found us,
more might be coming.
The unkindest cut of all.
We came here to help you.
Bullshit.
You came here for your own reasons.
And now mine takes priority.
I need to know
what happened to my father.
You've killed me many times.
It doesn't change the outcome.
How 'bout I kill your friend.
That change anything?
Right now, you need to focus
on your friends.
Oh, yeah, why is that?
One of them isn't who they claim to be.
- One of them will betray you.
- Bullshit.
Listen to him.
He's usually right about this stuff.
Really annoying, but right.
Fuck you. Who?
I've run all the possible iterations.
I wish I could tell you.
Sometimes it's your girlfriend, Odina.
Sometimes, it's Jay or Lindsay.
Hell, one time it was even Stubbs.
What?
Don't look at me.
The mole is still out there, C.
Your team went into the heart
of Hale's city.
But one of them didn't come back.
Shut the fuck up.
I know this is hard to hear,
but there's not a single version
where all of you
make it out of here alive.
So, what do you suggest that I do?
You're going to have to
kill one of them.
Or they will kill you.
I have to go.
I know.
Thought I could trust him.
He told you what you wanted to hear.
It's a hard thing to resist.
Did you find out what his plan is?
Just more riddles.
At least he can't do any more damage.
I don't know, C.
I think there's something more going on.
I'm not sure the two of them
are the only ones here
we can't trust.
You think one of us was turned?
Turned, parasited, I don't know.
But we were scattered out there.
It could've happened any time.
And what do we know
about this new outlier?
Maybe she was bait from the start.
C
right now, you're the only one
I can trust.
You weren't on that mission, plus
you never just tell me
what I want to hear.
So, what do we do?
Keep this situation on lockdown.
Leave me to worry about Lindsay
and the others.
You do a sweep of our defenses.
Meet here when you're done.
Okay.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
You following me?
No, I was looking for you.
You okay?
I'm just on edge.
Jay ordered me
to double check the perimeter.
Look, baby, what's going on?
You're not acting like yourself.
And I come back to find you rebuilding
that thing in there.
What were you thinking?
You wouldn't have to ask me
why she was important.
Not if you knew me.
I know you well enough to know,
you're not out here
checking our perimeter.
You're gonna go finish rebuilding her.
So, where'd you hide
this host brain of hers?
The fuck are you doing?
Just move.
- You think I'm one of them?
- Maybe.
Maybe you're under their control.
You might not even know it.
I'm sorry.
If you're not one of them,
you'll be safer here anyway.
He's still on the run,
but he won't get far.
These humans.
Their petty defiances.
Everything they do is so small,
it's exhausting.
You spend your days in the city.
I do.
Do they ever
get under your skin?
I don't get close to the outliers.
I prefer the sheep.
I'd like to put an end to this.
Shit!
Don't.
Hey, Frankie's alive.
Frankie
I have to
I have to get out of here. I
I need to reach her.
Use me.
Use me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hey, hey, Frankie,
slow down! Wait for me.
Daddy!
Hey, hey, hey. You okay?
Let me see that knee.
It's your very first battle scar.
You want to try walking on it?
It's impossible.
Hey. Nothing is impossible.
You know what kind of person
can't be beat?
The kind that doesn't give up.
All right?
There you go, baby.
There you go.
I met her.
Did you know that?
When I was a kid.
I had almost forgotten her face, but
never forgot what she took from me.
C I know why you want to wake her up.
But it's too risky.
We have no idea what
they were planning with her.
She could kill us all
the second she opens her eyes.
I still send him messages.
My dad.
On the radio, to our old frequency.
And I know that it is crazy
to think that he hears them.
But if there is any chance
that he's alive
I need to know.
I don't want you to get hurt, C.
All this will do is rip open
an old wound.
She can't bring him back.
We have to destroy her control unit
before Hale uses her to take us out.
And if your dad's out there,
we'll find him another way.
Together.
You're my family, C.
You're like a sister to me.
I can't lose you.
Bernard put her pearl downstairs.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
I know this is hard,
but we can't take the risk.
I know.
Jay could be a dick,
but at least he was honest.
He never wanted to be my brother.
Poor little C.
Always whining
about your fucking family.
It's pathetic.
I don't wanna kill you, C.
This is good news, C.
Maeve doesn't know anything
about your dad, but I do.
Show me where her pearl is,
and I'll tell you anything you want.
Don't bother with the negotiation.
Everything you say is bullshit.
Cookie.
Frankie. Hey.
It's your dad.
I know you're out there.
And if you're hearing this,
I want you to know that
you're going to win.
You're going to do what
I couldn't.
Because you are strong.
So much stronger than me.
This world
this world she she made is
it's a lie.
It's not real.
But what you what you have
What you have is
is real.
And I'm sorry that I failed
that I haven't been there for you
that now it has to be you.
But you can do this.
You're my warrior.
I love you.
Cookie.
Frankie. Hey. It's your dad.
I know you're out there.
And if you're hearing this,
I want you to know that
you're going to win.
You're going
Tell me where her pearl is.
Fuck you. I took it. I stashed it.
Where?
Behind you.
Caleb
I heard. Alive.
- You're his
- His daughter.
Of course you are.
What a disappointment.
I've waited such a long time
to know what you had
to tell your daughter.
You
Hundreds of times,
I sat through your stupid memory,
hoping to catch a single clue
as to what makes you so special,
so resistant to my command.
And I learned jack shit. So I thought,
nothing like a little hope
to get you to show your cards.
You made it farther
than any of the others,
and all you did was waste your shot
on a worthless apology.
You think a few words
will make up for the choices
you made all those years ago?
It doesn't matter.
It's done.
She didn't hear it.
She doesn't need to.
You're still going to lose.
We didn't infect your hosts.
You don't say.
Who did?
You.
Your hosts would rather die
than live in your world.
They're not infected.
They're just trying
to get away from you.
When I left
I thought I was giving him a chance.
I didn't think it would lead
to all this.
Part of me blamed you.
And part of me knew
that if there was any chance
he was alive,
it was because you were with him.
Everything you guys did
that's why we're here.
Well then
let's finish what we started.
Caleb.
Wake up.
