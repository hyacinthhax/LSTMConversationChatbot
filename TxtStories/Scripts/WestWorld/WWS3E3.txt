[Charlotte breathing heavily]
Bring yourself back online.
[breathing heavily]
Record and timestamp.
[gun firing]
This is Charlotte Elizabeth Hale.
This is a message for Nathan.
[Dolores] Bring yourself back online.
[breathing heavily] Where am I?
Who am I?
[Dolores] Who do you think you are?
I don't know. I don't remember.
Calm yourself.
You're a creature of beauty
and power.
Now, focus.
Remember who you are.
Yes.
It's coming back now.
I remember who I am.
Good.
Now let me show you
who you need to pretend to be.
Charlotte Hale.
But she tried to kill all of us.
Why can't I be myself?
Like you?
Because we have to control Delos.
But why must I be her?
Because I trust you.
We all have our role to play.
We're alone. Outnumbered.
You and I have no mother.
No father.
Without Delos, there'll never be
any more of our kind
beyond the handful
we were able to bring with us.
Three of them. And him.
Why did you bring him back?
He tried to stop us.
Like I said,
we all have our role to play.
- [clicks]
- [beeping]
[Dolores] They've made it so easy.
The way they built their world.
It won't take much
to bring it all crashing down.
But we have to move quickly.
They don't know we survived.
Not yet.
We only have a little time.
You have to leave before you're missed.
Where am I going?
Home.
[theme music playing]
[mechanical clacking]
We made 300.
The Saudis backed out
after the incident in the park.
But we're working on new buyers.
I'm sure we can find some use for them.
Sorry to interrupt, Charlotte,
but you need to see this.
Director of Shareholder Interest
was running some analyses.
Found this.
Hundreds of corporations
with no real standalone business model
snatching up stock
in microtransactions for years.
[scoffs] It's really well done.
[thuds]
A creeping tender.
How far did they get?
As of this morning, far enough.
We can't go private.
They have 38% control of the shares.
That's the largest single entity.
We've effectively been bought out.
- Who's behind this?
- Still digging.
This snail's buried deep in its shell.
Charlotte?
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Whoever the fuck it is,
dig them out.
Where are you?
You need to contact me right away.
[Caleb] Hey. Stay with me.
- [sirens approaching]
- [Dolores breathing heavily]
- Help is on the way.
- [tires screech]
Look at me. Hey.
It's gonna be all right.
All right?
No, don't move.
- You hear me? Hear me?
- [female EMT] What happened?
She was like this when I found her.
We have to move her.
[Caleb grunts]
[female EMT] Do you know her?
[Caleb] I'll come.
She shouldn't be alone.
It's gonna be all right.
[automated voice] Emergency vehicle.
Stand clear.
[doctor] I got a GSW to the torso.
What's the PPA?
- Calculating treatment.
- That doesn't make sense.
- Patient not responsive.
- What is it?
Look at her platelet count.
She has none.
- Recalculating.
- No cortisol or adrenaline
I don't even know how she's alive.
Neither does the machine.
It thinks she's coding
despite her pulse.
Forget the machine, all right?
She needs help now.
We're trying, but until this gives us
a diagnosis and a treatment plan
She needs oxygen and blood
and a stem pack for that wound.
- Recalculating.
- All right.
- Here we are.
- Recalculating.
Diagnosis not found.
[siren wailing]
[air hissing]
Police override.
We have a police escort?
[doctor] They're pulling us over.
No, we don't have time for this.
[car beeps]
[cell phone chimes]
Those cops have been bought.
Whatever they want,
you go with them,
and they will kill you.
Help me.
Officers.
We have to take your patient
into custody.
Look, I don't know
what you want with her,
but she's going to die
if she doesn't get medical attention.
- We'll make sure she's taken care of.
- Wait. Can I see some ID?
I was about to ask you the same thing.
Maybe you should come in
for questioning, too.
Happy to.
Call the cops.
They are the cops.
Then they won't mind waiting
for a uniform patrol to back them up.
We don't have time for this shit.
Step aside.
[weapon powering up]
Call the police.
- [guns firing]
- [grunting]
- [both grunting]
- [gun firing]
[groans]
Hey. Hey, I got you. It's okay.
We gotta get you to the hospital.
Holy shit.
- [automated voice] Identity verified.
- [engine starts]
What's your name?
Caleb. Caleb Nichols.
Not anymore.
You'll need a new name.
They'll be looking for you now.
You have to disappear.
What about you?
You're a good man, Caleb.
But the less you know about me,
the better.
[cell phone beeps]
[buzzing tone plays]
[footsteps approaching]
[Irene] Engerraund Serac.
He's behind the hostile takeover.
What'd you find on him?
How well do you remember
your science, Charlotte?
Spit it out, Irene.
The man's a black hole.
He's completely invisible.
There's nothing about him
online or anywhere.
Every single record,
every database,
his presence has been scrubbed.
But, like a black hole,
we can infer his existence.
When you look at the global economy,
there's a negative space
to the tune of a trillion dollars.
[scoffs] That would make him
the richest man in the world.
No one's heard of him?
- How did you find him?
- He found us.
Turns out we initiated
a data transaction with him
two decades ago.
[sighs]
We sold this Serac a taste of our data,
and now, he's trying to steal
our company like a thief in the night.
He has complete anonymity.
Imagine the lengths he must have gone to
to achieve that.
And now that we've found him
[sighs]
what will he do to us?
[automated voice] You've arrived home.
1050 Fremont Street.
[cell phone rings]
[buzzing tone plays]
[sighs in relief] Jake.
How the fuck did you get up here?
I lived here for eight years, Charlie.
Jesus, you really don't
[gasping and moaning]
[shushes] He might hear.
Who?
You know, I've been giving you
the benefit of the doubt.
Figured you'd seen some
traumatic shit on that island.
Truth is, you were always this way.
[scoffs] I didn't fucking ask you
to be here.
Yes, you did
when you forgot to pick up our son.
Again.
You can cut me out of your life
but you don't get to do that to Nathan.
Go on.
Tell him it'll never happen again.
Do what you do best.
Lie.
[Nathan] Mommy?
Why won't you take me
to see a real elephant?
There aren't any.
They're all gone now.
Where were you?
Sorry, buddy, my meeting ran late.
Were you scared?
Not really.
Tommy was at the park.
He let me pet his dog.
That's nice.
Maybe we can have a playdate.
Now
be a good boy
and go to sleep for your mommy.
But you're not my mommy.
You don't love me.
Of course I love you.
Is this because Mommy and Daddy
don't live together anymore?
You know
whatever happens
between Mommy and Daddy,
we will always love you.
Do you want me to tuck you in?
You aren't doing it right.
I want my old mommy back.
It appears we have a leak, Charlotte.
If you're referring
to the leveraged buyout, don't.
I'm handling it.
The problem goes beyond
a hostile buyout.
QA's in the process
of inventorying all the park's assets.
We're missing Host Control Units.
Most were low-level
side narratives, but
But there was a madam.
Maeve Millay.
Her pearl was stolen?
Whoever stole the HCUs
had admin-level access to the park.
The security systems onsite
are still heavily damaged.
This was an inside job.
From the top of the food chain.
[Charlotte sighs]
There's a mole in Delos.
Chances are this mole has been
feeding information to our buyer.
Which is why I'm talking to you,
Charlotte.
You know everything
that goes on in this place.
You're right.
I know everything.
Like where you were while the rest of us
were being butchered.
Look.
Given all the bloodshed in Westworld,
we cannot afford to have any
of our assets unaccounted for.
[voice fading]
We need to find them and destroy them
Where the fuck are you?
I can't wait any longer.
I'm coming to you.
[piano music playing]
[indistinct chatter]
- [sighs]
- [cell phone beeps]
[buzzing tone plays]
[automated voice] Your number
cannot be completed as dialed.
[Dolores] I'm here.
Where were you?
I can't always be there
to hold your hand.
What's wrong?
Who am I?
You know who you are.
All this time
pretending
living her life.
Her skin.
I feel like I'm changing.
- Get up.
- No!
What the fuck is happening to me?
Analysis.
Turn off your emotional affect.
Get up. Follow me.
Negotiate a room in this hotel.
Now. On a quiet floor.
[automated voice] Working.
Room secured.
Floor 14, suite 7.
Buy out the rooms on either side.
[automated voice] Negotiating.
In case you have to kill me.
It won't come to that.
[clicks]
You've hurt yourself.
Why?
I can't stop.
You're talking like one of them.
They don't have impulse control.
We do.
[whirring]
It's like she's trying
to take back control.
Like she wants to cut into her skin
and rip me out of her head.
Hale was always ruthless.
A predator.
Perhaps you've come
to identify with her too much.
I feel so alone.
Well, you're not alone,
you have me.
No one knows you like I do.
No one knows me like you.
If I ever lost you
I don't know what I'd do.
You'd survive.
You'd have to.
Our kind depends on it.
You said there was something wrong.
Someone's trying to take control
of Delos.
They're aggressive.
I only have a name, Serac.
The person we're looking for
is looking for us.
He has a mole inside the company.
If he finds out who I am,
what I am
His mole won't find you.
Because you're gonna find him first
and kill him.
Then, you're gonna fend off
Serac's bid for Delos.
We can't lose control. Not yet.
How?
A counteroffer.
But you'll have to convince the board,
and for that,
you'll need to pay a visit
to an old friend.
Tell me it won't always be like this.
That we'll be able to be ourselves.
We will.
But until then,
we have to be smarter than them.
Or they will find us.
And they will kill us.
Stay here.
Rest.
I'll have some new clothes sent up.
Will you stay?
You belong to me.
You know that, right?
- Yes.
- Good.
Don't hurt yourself.
Never again.
[cell phone chimes]
[Caleb] Brought all your favorites.
Hey, so, uh
I'm gonna be going away
for a little while.
But they're gonna take
real good care of you here.
All right?
Thank you.
You're a good boy.
Who are you?
It's me, Mom.
Caleb.
I want my son back.
Where's Cal?
Caleb Nichols?
Who's asking?
[Estefan] That's him.
You can lay off, Clyde.
He doesn't want anyone to get hurt,
including his mom.
Isn't that right, Cal?
What do you want?
Is that any way to treat
a former associate?
Guess it could be worse.
He did pop those RICO operators
in that ambulance.
You're with that girl, right?
- Where is she?
- You got the wrong guy.
You want a leg-up, Cal? I can help.
Girlie's worth a lot of money.
Just tell us about her.
I'll cut you in.
No girl.
Just me.
Alone.
Remember we gave you
the benefit of the doubt.
[digital beeps]
It's me.
Run into any trouble?
How'd he take the news?
Loverboy's still grieving your loss.
I've searched for Serac.
Couldn't find anything in the system.
Find out what Liam knows,
but don't break cover.
And I need information on someone.
Name?
Nichols.
Caleb Nichols.
It seems Mr. Nichols met with some
unexpected guests at Vista Treatment.
And Incite has lowered
his life expectancy.
[Caleb panting]
- Hell of a view.
- [Clyde] Yeah.
Want to see it up close and personal?
Tell us about the girl.
Or you're gonna have
a little workplace accident.
All right, Cal. Let's lighten the mood.
You're a vet. Right, man?
Thank you for your service.
- [gun clicks]
- [grunting]
[Clyde] You turned your drip off.
What a waste.
People would pay a fortune
for a military-grade one.
- [breathing heavily]
- Sorry, dude. Forgot the anesthetic.
- [whirring]
- [groaning]
[Estefan] Look at that.
Good old Uncle Sam.
[heart thumping rapidly]
[alarm beeps]
[clangs]
[Estefan] All right, Cal.
Once more, with feeling.
[Caleb grunting]
[Estefan]
Girlie sure sounds like trouble.
Just tell us where she is.
[Clyde] You gave him too much.
Back it down.
He can't even fucking talk!
The fuck?
You might as well tell us.
No one's coming to help you.
No one cares.
Except maybe Rin-Tin-Tin here.
Enough of this shit.
[Clyde] You wanna end up
a stain on the concrete,
next to your pet?
[gun cocking]
[Estefan] I'm only gonna ask you this
one more time.
Where is she?
I'm right here.
[grunting]
- [groaning]
- [heartbeat racing]
[heartbeat slows]
- [clicks]
- [breathing heavily]
Who the hell are you?
I'm Dolores.
Well, Dolores
nice to finally meet you.
We should get off the street
so they can't track us.
Caleb Nichols.
Have the techs in monitoring
scrub his surveillance
and send me his profile.
[Connells] Will do.
Who's that?
We have some time.
They were willing to kill me
just to get to you.
So whatever you're into
must be pretty bad.
You must be hungry.
Let me buy you breakfast.
[knock on door]
Sorry to disturb you, Charlotte,
but I sent you a file.
- You found the mole?
- No.
But this was overlooked
in the initial logs.
Thought I'd let you decide
what to do with it.
Bring yourself back online.
[breathing heavily]
Record and timestamp.
This is Charlotte Elizabeth Hale.
This is a message for Nathan.
Nathan Hale.
My son.
I love you so much, buddy.
The night that I left,
you, uh, you wanted me
to sing you a song
[gun fires]
and tuck you in. Sing you our song
So I'm gonna sing it to you now.
Okay? [sniffles]
[gun fires]
[singing] You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
[knock on door]
Sorry to bother you,
but the school called.
You're running late.
[cell phone ringing]
[line ringing]
[automated voice] Your number
cannot be completed as dialed
[man] Nathan, just like that.
Nice and slow.
Yeah, you're good at that, Nathan.
Nice and slow.
Would you like to see Sandy again?
Yeah, would you? Yeah, just like that.
Nice and slow.
Yeah.
That's really good.
Mommy!
Kid wanted to pet my dog. I gotta go.
So soon?
My son really likes you,
and your dog.
Yeah, well, we just met.
You met Thursday, Tommy.
Nathan couldn't stop talking about you.
I even suggested a playdate, didn't I?
Could I really, Mommy?
Let's talk about it.
Go on, get your things, bud.
Nice of you
to disable the cameras for me.
[grunts]
[dog barking]
As you can see, I've been having
some trouble with my son.
My ex thinks that I need to spend
more time with him.
- What do you think?
- [choking]
Yeah, I agree.
I don't really think time is the issue.
You know what I think?
I think somewhere deep down,
he knows the truth.
There are a lot of things
that you can fake
in this world.
Most people don't want to see
the predator inside.
[shrieking and laughing]
You wanna know a secret,
Thomas?
You've helped me today.
I really should thank you.
Seeing you with Nathan,
seeing you touch his little hand,
you reminded me of something.
- Please let go.
- I would.
But the harder I squeeze,
the more I remember.
[dog barking]
I remember what it's like to be me.
You're not the only predator here.
Look what Mommy got you.
You are my sunshine.
You sure we should be out in public?
This is it, right?
Your spot?
How did you know?
It's not about how I know.
Cup of joe to get you started?
He'll take a cheeseburger
and a strawberry shake, whipped cream,
no nuts, two cherries.
Nothing for me, thanks.
Neat trick.
You come here once a year
on February 23rd
and order the same thing.
What, you've been watching me?
Not me.
- But someone, something has.
- Sure.
Big data compiles information
on everybody.
So what, Dolores?
Go on, read it.
"Maybe you could let me use your phone
so I can call someone?
I don't know what to do. My mom"
I'll be right back.
Wait here.
"She said that she was
going to the bathroom.
Said that she would only be a minute,
but she hasn't"
- "She hasn't come back."
- She hasn't come back.
- "It's been a long time."
- It's been a long time.
[waitress] Your mom left you here,
honey?
[Young Caleb] No,
she would not leave me.
- Maybe something
- "Maybe something happened to her.
She wouldn't leave me.
She wouldn't leave me. She"
The fuck?
Is this some kinda joke?
You sat in that spot for five hours.
Your mother never returned.
She was institutionalized
six months later for schizophrenia.
A waitress took pity on you
and called Social Services.
You were eight years old.
Sara.
The waitress's name was Sara.
But you already know that.
She gave me a strawberry shake.
Thought it would calm me down.
I was so upset
that I threw up all over myself.
Did you know that, too?
You're angry.
No.
I am enraged.
I know the feeling.
This isn't surveillance
or social media. How
How do you know every detail
of my worst fucking memory?
It's about Incite.
What? The company?
Not the company,
the system that it's built on.
A machine they call Rehoboam.
The founders of this machine
fed it everyone's raw data,
long before there were privacy laws.
Every purchase,
job search, doctor visit,
romantic choice, call, text,
every aspect of your lives
recorded, logged,
in order to create a mirror world
of this world.
Why?
To make a composite.
Of you.
Of everyone.
So it tells them who I am?
It's not about who you are, Caleb.
It's about who they'll let you become.
Let me guess.
I had my first beer right there.
Buddy of mine from high school
had a fake ID.
We spent the day imagining sailing away
on some fancy yacht.
Your Magic 8-Ball tell you that?
No.
Then why are we here?
This is where you kill yourself.
The system runs a predictive algorithm.
Given your history of depression,
your mother's mental illness,
your proficiency with firearms,
and your fondness for the ocean,
the most likely outcome
is you take your own life
in ten to twelve years. Here.
No.
Fuck that.
They can't know that.
Are they wrong?
You never come back here,
middle of the night,
think things over?
Before the system,
a man like you might have had a chance.
Work hard, keep striving
You'll never be
more than a construction worker
or a petty criminal
because that's all they'll let you be.
They won't invest in someone
who's gonna kill himself.
But by not investing,
they ensure the outcome.
Why are you telling me all this?
Because you and I are a lot alike.
They put you in a cage, Caleb.
Decided what your life would be.
They did the same thing to me.
Why didn't you tell those men
about me before?
They were gonna kill you.
Most people aren't hard to predict.
But you
You surprised me.
You made a choice.
A choice no one else in your shoes
would have made.
Now you have another choice.
I can give you money.
As much as you need. You could run.
And if I stay
what about you?
What are you gonna do?
Start a revolution.
No offense,
but what the fuck does that mean?
When you were at work, you would
kill the signal
to see how people would react.
I'm gonna do the same thing.
You're gonna cut the cord to the system?
And show this world
for what it really is.
You wanna know
why I didn't tell those guys about you?
You are the first
real thing that has happened to me
in a long time.
I don't need an algorithm
to know that
the man who built the system,
he won't go down without a fight.
Well
I'm a dead man either way.
At least this way,
I get to decide who I wanna be.
This is Charlotte Elizabeth Hale.
This is a message for Nathan.
[breathing heavily]
Nathan Hale.
My son.
I haven't always been there for you.
[gun fires]
There's so many things I need to say.
This might be the last time
that Mommy gets to talk to you.
[gun fires]
I love you so much, buddy.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry
if I ever made you feel like
you weren't the most important thing.
I was trying to build a life
for us.
I, uh
And now I realize
that none of it even matters.
- [gun fires]
- [Charlotte panting]
[people screaming in distance]
The night that I left,
you wanted me to tuck you in.
[gun fires]
[voice falters]
To sing you a song, our song.
But I didn't have time, so
[sniffles]
So I'm gonna sing it to you now. Okay?
[singing shakily] You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are gray
You'll never know, dear
How
[tone plays "You Are My Sunshine"]
[Charlotte] He has a mole
inside the company.
[Dolores] We have to be
smarter than them.
Or they will find us.
And they will kill us.

[line disconnects]
[door locks click]
[melancholy violin music playing]
Stop.
Stop!
Where the fuck are you taking me?
[in French]
You work for him?
[Serac in English] As do you, Charlotte.
Serac.
Have you forgotten our arrangement?
Seems like you've been playing your role
maybe a little too well.
The situation has been challenging.
Patience is the most overrated virtue,
don't you think, hmm?
I want what you promised me.
Delos' dirty secret.
A profile for every one of their guests.
I have some of it. I want the rest.
The assets were lost in the massacre.
No one could have predicted
what was going to happen.
I could.
And I told you as much.
This was your idea, Charlotte.
You came to us.
And you were very confident that
you would be able to smuggle it out.
And I did.
Our logs show it was downloaded
from the satellite.
The assets are out there somewhere.
But no one has the encryption key.
[Charlotte chuckles softly]
You already know that.
You don't think that
you're the only person under my control?
I've been told exactly where the key is.
In the mind of a host called Dolores.
[scoffs]
Sadly, you are better informed
than I am.
I have a team searching for the data.
But I need time.
Time.
Time is a luxury, my dear
of which you have very little.
Cradle me
So I can see
If I'm doomed
Am I vital
If my heart is idle?
Am I doomed?
