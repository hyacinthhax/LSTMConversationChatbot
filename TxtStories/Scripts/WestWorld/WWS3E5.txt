[Serac speaking French]
[President Filo speaking Portuguese]
[in English]
I don't have time, I'm afraid.
There is a nascent
- separatist movement
- [indistinct talking over earpiece]
in the north of your country.
[speaking Portuguese]
[in English] Your intelligence knows
only what I want them to.
[fly buzzing]
There is a small group.
Anomalies.
Even they won't know they will act
until they do.
Rehoboam is privy
to all sorts of hidden truths.
For example,
the private deals you've cut
to restrict manganese extraction
to some of your friends,
which have squeezed money
out of villages in the north,
creating unrest.
You will stop.
And the problem will go away.
[speaking Portuguese]
[in English]
Our arrangement is founded in trust.
We trusted that you would do
what you're told
when we ensured your election.
[speaking Portuguese]
[in English] That fellow
the one with the big mustache.
Understood?
[theme music playing]
[Serac] It turns out that
building a God,
as your ancestors can attest,
is not easy.
More than anything, we needed data.
Which meant we needed him.
Dempsey was rich, arrogant.
He had been in the right place
at the right time,
before the privacy laws.
And now his company, Incite,
had the entire world's data.
[Dempsey] It's not
fucking working.
I paid a king's ransom for this thing,
fed you yottabytes of Incite's data,
and for what?
You've iterated half a dozen versions,
Saul, David, and now this one.
What the fuck's its name again?
Solomon.
Well, I'm not sinking another dollar
into this giant steel ballsack
while it's spitting out
false predictions.
[Jean Mi] Not false.
It rendered
the last few decades accurately,
predicting past events with certainty.
[Dempsey] You built a machine
to predict the fucking past?
Well, let me try. Eighteen months ago,
I made the worst
business decision of my career
by trusting you idiots.
Keep staring at that thing, Liam,
your brain's gonna turn to mush
like these two.
What about strategizing the future?
That's what you promised.
Societal trends,
the stock market, a fucking oracle!
[speaking French]
[in English] No, I'm sorry.
I'm pulling the plug.
Come on, Liam.
[Serac] What Dempsey didn't understand
was that it was working.
My brother had done it.
He created a God.
But such is the case
with all great minds.
He was uniquely brilliant,
but also, uniquely troubled.
I have news, sir.
But not good.
If it's news, it's unexpected,
which is never good. What is it?
Rehoboam analyzed the traffic
coming out of the Yakuza facility.
It found a connect
between encrypted devices
in Jakarta, Berlin,
San Francisco, and Los Angeles.
- The one in L.A. is a problem.
- Why?
It came from inside
Liam Dempsey's personal compound.
- Find Dempsey. Now.
- We've tried, sir.
Rehoboam logged him entering
a private function.
Now he's missing.
- And, sir
- [device beeps]
He wasn't alone.
Activate every asset we have.
I want her caught.
Yes, sir.
[Caleb] I called backup. What now?
[Dolores] We keep moving.
Serac can't locate us if we're mobile.
[Liam] You think you disappear a man
like me and no one fucking notices?
Keep walking.
We have all of his money.
What do we need him for?
[Dolores] Access.
We need to study our adversary,
past, present, future.
To do that, we need access
to the deeper layers of the system.
You expect me to give you access?
Fuck you, "Lara." Whoever you are.
You wanna know who I am?
- [glasses beep]
- Go ahead.
You're not even in the system.
You're a blank space.
You've become complacent,
believing those
let you understand everyone.
It doesn't matter.
You can't take me anywhere
he won't find you.
- He's already looking for you.
- And you.
Serac knows by now that
you're trying to outbid him on Delos.
I'm what?
We can help.
If you give us your private key,
we can unlock the system.
You'll never get in.
My access isn't enough.
You'll need to connect at the node,
bypass onsite security.
Either we find a way
to defeat him together,
or we all die.
Then I guess you die.
I'll take my chances.
[whispering] Hey. She used me.
Have you asked yourself
what she's using you for yet?
Let me go, I'll make sure
you're taken care of.
You already took care of me.
You sent me off to war
slaughtered my friends
on the battlefield.
What do these tell you about me now?
What, that I swallow my own gun
on some beach?
Go on. Tell me who I am.
[glasses whir]
You think I killed your friend?
What did you see?
Who are you people?
What did you see?
Get away from me!
[Caleb groans]
[groaning]
[exhales]
[Liam] Stop, stop, stop! Don't hurt me.
Don't hurt me. All right, I'll come.
[Dolores] What is it?
What did you give him?
[Liam] It's some kind of party drug.
Called Genre.
- [Dolores] What does it do?
- [Liam] I don't know.
[echoing] Are you okay?
We have to move.
They'll find us.
[suspenseful film noir music playing]
[indistinct]
Don't go too far.
We need to get across town.
I need a vehicle now.
[virtual assistant]
Rideshare vehicle located.
Arriving now.
- Get in.
- Just give this up.
I told you my men would find me.
Those aren't your men, they're his.
[automated navigator]
Destination selected.
They're using your system to track us.
I'd appreciate the irony,
but I'm sitting beside you.
Give me your private key.
I can erase us from the system.
If they're after us,
why haven't they made a move?
[Caleb] They're waiting
to get us alone
to kill us.
[notification pings]
[navigator] An amber alert
has been issued for this vehicle.
- Pulling over.
- Fuck.
[navigator] Please remain calm.
The authorities have been notified,
and the situation will be dealt with.
[grunts]
[tires screeching]
[navigator]
The authorities have been notified,
and the situation will be dealt with
in a timely manner.
[Caleb] Oh, fuck!
Everything runs
on your company's server, Liam.
Even this car.
[navigator]
Network connection lost.
Give me your access. I can save you.
[automated voice]
Private key required.
[Liam] What the fuck is this?
He can't kill me, he needs me.
Evidently not.
Decide. Now.
[automated voice]
Private key required.
[rapid gunfire]
[automated voice] Verified.
Enable semi-automatic control.
Disable safety features.
Maximum speed. Go.
[Dolores] What's happening to him?
[Liam] I think he's switching genres.
["Ride of the Valkyries" playing]
We need distance. Head south.
That's not standard issue.
- [Dolores] No
- [gun clicks]
It's not.
Point and shoot.
[grunting]
Police ahead.
- Maintain speed.
- [navigator] Maintaining speed.
- Sharp left. Now.
- [navigator] Turning left.
[Caleb] Whoa!
Whoa!
- I missed.
- Hold on.
All right, I need you.
Drop in, intercept, maximum speed.
- Arm charges now.
- [powering up]
- Accelerate.
- [navigator] Acceleration at 90%.
- More.
- [navigator] 94%.
- More.
- [navigator] 98%.
Stop.
[tires screeching]
[Liam] Why the fuck are we stopping?
[Dolores] Get down.
[Love Story theme playing]
[muffled gunshots]
[gunfire resumes]
Come on.
["Bubbles Buried in This Jungle"
by Death Grips playing]
You rang?
[Giggles] Who's the killer?
- Nice to meet you.
- [Ash] Likewise.
Glad to see
you're finally doing personals, Cal.
What's up with Little Lord Fauntleroy?
Shit, you know this asshole.
Liam Dempsey. Incite.
Make King Midas look like Tom Canty.
We need him. Alive.
Shit, man.
I know what you on.
Genre. It's like five drips in one.
- A movie marathon.
- [inhales deeply]
Hey. Watch out
for that last act, though.
Yeah, we better move, lover boy.
I already saw two more on your tail.
This way.
[Liam] Easy, easy. Okay.
[Dolores] We have to keep moving
so they can't track us
while I access Rehoboam.
We have Liam's private key,
but we can't stop,
or Serac can locate us.
If they kill him, I lose my access.
What access? You took my biometrics,
but you can't get into the system,
it's read-only.
Unless you're standing at the node.
[chuckles]
You can't be in two places at once.
[earpiece beeps]
[phone ringing]
I'm sending you his key.
I need Serac's file.
I want to know everything
Rehoboam knows about its master.
And after?
They'll come for me. And then you.
[Dolores] Protect our friend first.
I will.
Bernard.
When I press this button,
I expect you to be
on your best behavior.
You.
Take a piss.
[automated voice]
Liam Dempsey. Access granted.
[Connells] This is their God.
This is how they see the future.
How they make the future.
In order to do that,
they watch everyone.
Tell them what to do,
where to live, who to love.
Keep them all in a loop.
What does she want with it?
You've always been of two minds,
haven't you, Bernard?
It isn't that binary.
Living another person's life
changes you.
Worlds bleed.
Maybe you felt that, too.
Have you ever questioned
what she's asking you to do?
[automated voice] Request complete.
Initiating transfer.
File transfer received.
["Nightclubbing" by Iggy Pop plays]
Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people, brand new people
- Hey. Where we headed?
- West.
Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
Oh, isn't it wild?
[music fades]
[Serac] My brother and I
built a system that worked.
But Dempsey wanted to see proof.
So we started with something simple,
purely mathematical.
The stock market.
We showed him all the major indices,
15 minutes in the future
and where it could close that night.
Which number is it? Low or high?
Which one do you want?
[chuckles]
[Serac] We put some money
into a hedge fund.
We let the system trade with it.
Something to drive the market
towards our outcomes.
Whose funds?
[Jean Mi] Yours.
A hundred million dollars?
What, you stole
$100 million from corporate accounts?
No.
We stole five million.
Last week.
[Serac] He didn't really understand
what we'd made,
what you were.
But we did.
He only saw the money he could make.
But we realized the power of it,
that you could reshape the world.
My brother and I,
we charted a course
for the entire human race.
Humanity's story had been improvised.
Now, it was planned years in advance.
For a time, the sun and moon aligned.
We brought order from chaos.
And then,
as with all the best laid plans,
it began to fall apart.
Dempsey became greedy,
drove outcomes to benefit himself.
So we locked him out of the system.
But there was a bigger problem.
In every projection,
the world came unglued.
There were people, outliers, agitators,
who you couldn't predict or control.
And I realized that my brother
was one of them.
He didn't fit the world any more,
and the world didn't fit him.
And it drove him mad.
What now?
We're going to open their cages.
The system's written their life story,
they should get to read it.
You can't do that.
That's reckless.
You have no idea
what they'll do in response.
It could lead to suicides, murder.
Murder.
You'd know something about that.
I'm sorry.
I'm so fucking sorry.
That
- wasn't my choice.
- Wasn't my choice.
- I could never bring myself to hurt you.
- I could never bring myself to hurt you.
Don't forget, I know you.
And you wouldn't hurt me.
You'd pay someone to do it for you.
It's their fate, their data.
You just stole it
and put it all together.
Why should you control it?
[Liam] This isn't about me. Or Incite.
There are some things
people shouldn't know about themselves.
Who gets to decide what they know?
- You?
- [Liam] Fine. You wanna see?
[glasses beep]
Take your friend here.
He'll be lucky
if he ends up dead in a ditch.
What about me? I wanna see my file.
Oh.
The golden boy brother of yours?
You tell yourself that you do all this
so you can help him make good,
send him to school,
give him a future.
But where he ends up
he's gonna make you look like a saint.
When I was overseas,
the rats were awful.
It got so bad that
we had to make our own rat traps
in the barracks.
A ramp leading up to some bait
strung over a bucket of water.
The rats would run up the ramp,
fall in, and drown.
Painlessly.
But if you filled the water too high,
they would swim around for hours,
suffering because they had hope.
But they never had a chance.
Just like everyone at the mercy
of your system.
Hope is what our entire society
is built on.
False hope.
I would rather live in chaos
than a world controlled by you.
[Dolores] Prepare to send all of them
their Incite profiles.
Past, present, future.
It'll be done.
[Connells] They've all been
riding a train.
We're gonna show them the rails.
[earpiece beeps]
Do it.
[phone ringing]
[Ash] It knows these kind of things?
About all of us?
[Dolores] It's not just what it knows.
It's what it decides.
For you.
For everyone.
- What are you doing?
- [replies indistinctly]
[automated voice]
Doors opening. Stand clear.
This train has reached
its final destination.
[Connells] Almost time, Bernard.
You'll have to choose a side.
Not just me.
You said they'd come for you.
Maybe you don't want
to die on her sword.
We all have our role to play.
Some of us won't survive.
["Space Oddity" playing]
I hope you're happy.
You just ruined everyone's life
in this station.
Not just them.
I sent it to everyone.
What do you mean, everyone?
The whole world.
[music continues playing]
She's sending them off their loops.
The right information
at the right time
is deadlier than any weapon.
[music continues playing]
What genre is this?
It's reality, man.
[indistinct shouting]
Look at them.
Already returned to their base selves.
[music distorts]
[guns click]
[heart thumping]
[grunts]
[Serac] I knew that you
and I built a fragile peace,
that one day,
it would all come crashing down
if I failed to act.
For ten years,
Dempsey was happy to cash the checks,
take credit for making
the world a better place,
even though he had no idea what we,
or the system, were doing.
But I knew one day, his curiosity
would get the better of him.
[woman sobbing]
Sir? Are you authorized to be here?
I'm here to see Engerraund Serac.
[Dempsey] What is this place?
After our exposure,
we were both put on
anti-radiation medications
to halt our genetic breakdown.
That's when I understood.
It's possible to edit people.
But the truth is
his personality was always like this.
I've been trying to help him.
What, you're experimenting
on your own goddamn brother?
He's impulsive, chaotic
I thought it was manageable.
Then I caught him using the system.
Trying out certain scenarios.
There are the times
you need to leave things behind.
[chuckles] He taught me that.
My brother is part
of a population of outliers,
and as long as they are a part of us
there is no future for us.
Rehoboam sends this group
to high-risk sectors like war,
a woodchipper to eat them up
and spit them out,
dead or useless.
Isn't helping them
better than killing them off?
You're not helping them.
You're changing them.
We adapt or we die.
We all die.
The scenarios I found
him exploring with Rehoboam
He was planning to murder you.
[Connells] It's begun.
Serac will send someone for us soon.
But there's something
you have to see first.
[Bernard]
What is this, some type of facility?
That's where he puts them,
the ones that don't belong.
You thought we were the enemy?
We're the only family you have left.
I think you forgot about me.
[grunting]
Little help?
[grunting]
We need to know
everything she has planned.
[Stubbs] Let's move along now.
All right?
[speaking French]
Who is that?
[Connells] Serac sent them.
You two should leave,
before they kill us all.
Come with us.
My role is finished.
You're the only one we can't replace.
Mr. Serac would like a word.
[speaks French]
[projector beeps]
You've always been one of
our most loyal allies, Martin.
So I was surprised to hear
the breach came from this location.
Let me look into it.
[device beeps]
Of course, you understand
we must keep our friends close
until we know who's to blame.
But I know exactly who's to blame.
Who?
Me.
[device beeps]
[gasps]
[alarm blaring]
[automated voice] Please remain calm
and make your way to the nearest exit.
[people clamoring]
[automated voice
in Mandarin]
Yo, what the fuck happened in there?
And what the fuck happened out here?
Her plan. It's starting.
I think I'm part of it.
["Dies Irae" playing]
Back there
The shooters
We can talk about it later.
First, we need to get to the airfield.
We don't need him anymore.
What do you want to do with him?
Hand them over.
You took everything from me,
my money, my access to the system
I have nothing left.
Yeah, well, now you know how it feels.
Just let me go.
You got the specs.
Is that how it plays out?
No.
You'll take what little I have left,
like the petty criminals that you are,
that you'll always be.
[Ash] Maybe so.
Go ahead.
Now you're going to see that
the system isn't the prison.
You are. To all of us.
We can't fix you.
And we can't get rid of you.
Take it easy.
Get the fuck away from me.
You don't even know who you are.
You're the worst of them.
- [heart thumping]
- Shut up.
[Liam] You're the worst of them.
Rehoboam was right.
You're nothing.
You're all nothings.
Just a drag on the fucking system.
You don't have a choice.
You know how much more progress
we could have made
if none of you had ever been
[gunshot]
Guess I do have a choice.
- [Liam] No. Get away.
- [Caleb] Hey.
- [Liam] No.
- [Caleb] Fuck. Hey.
- [Liam] Get away!
- [Caleb] Hey.
Shit.
[groans, sobs]
[groaning]
[distorted] Hey. Hey! Hey!
- Let's go.
- Hold on.
Get away!
Don't move. It's okay,
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Get away from me. Get away!
You You You
- What?
- You did it.
What are you saying?
- You did it.
- What?
You did it.
Who does he think I am?
[shouting] Who does he think I am?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
Who do you think I am?
[Sebastian] Sir, we identified
which files Dolores was looking for.
Yours.
[Dempsey] You can't change our fate.
You can't geld humankind.
Somewhere in this group is an agitator
who will destroy the world.
I can't let that happen.
Hey, you've gone too far.
No, I can't be a party to this.
You'd be content to let history
continue to play out,
just as it has done for centuries,
the same fucking misery
repeated over and again
when we have a chance to stop it?
What the fuck's that?
I'm gonna tell everyone
what Rehoboam saw.
What you've done.
The trouble is,
Rehoboam ran millions of projections.
Every scenario in which
you inform the public about my trials
ends in human extinction.
This is why my brother
wanted to kill you.
I looked, too.
And I know you let me
walk away from here.
I would tend to agree
with the system, but see,
there are little white spaces,
rare moments when randomness
interacts with your life,
that create a truly free space
where you can make a choice.
A bubble of agency.
[Serac] And that is
how you came to be, mon ami.
My brother and I
brought you into this world,
and now I've ensured
that you will outlive us both,
that the strategy will succeed.
I left my brother behind.
Do you think I would really let you
undo everything he built?
That's my jet.
[Serac] Forgive us our sins.
What we did, we did to save the world.
I'm sorry.
You didn't make it.
[grunts]
[Serac] This is my system, Dolores.
I alone control it.
The people who made me,
they always thought they had control.
They're all dead now.
You think you know me
because you've watched
a few of my memories?
I don't need to know you.
Just how to beat you.
You've died too many times, Dolores.
You're beginning to think
you're immortal.
I can be killed.
Same as you.
Your God can't protect you.
Or your people.
I would sacrifice much more
to protect my kind.
We are flawed
but I can change that.
Like you changed your brother?
It's time everyone woke up.
[grunts]
- What's this?
- I just deliver it, man.
["Emerge" by Fischerspooner playing]
Maybe Liam was right.
Maybe people shouldn't know
their own fate.
People have the right to know.
You wanted to know, right?
Well, maybe I'm not like other people.
Neither am I.
